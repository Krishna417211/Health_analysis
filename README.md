# Body Fat Percentage Prediction using Machine Learning & Gradio

## ðŸš€ Project Overview  
This project uses a machine-learning model (linear regression) to **predict body-fat percentage** from measurable features such as weight, BMI, calories intake, lean-mass estimation, and calorie-balance. A web interface built with Gradio allows users to input their data (weight, height, calories intake) and get an instant prediction.  
Itâ€™s designed to demonstrate:  
- Data preprocessing & feature engineering (BMI, lean mass, calorie balance)  
- Building & evaluating a regression model with scikitâ€‘learn  
- Deploying a user-friendly interface in Google Colab (and for later production use)

## âœ¨ Features  
- Calculates derived features: BMI, calorie balance, lean mass  
- Trains a linear regression model on these features to predict fat percentage  
- Provides a Gradio web interface to input values and view predictions  
- Easy to extend for more advanced modelling (e.g., tree-based, deep learning) or deployment  

## ðŸ“Š Dataset & Features  
- **Target**: Body fat percentage (`Fat_Percentage`)  
- **Input Features** (used in model):  
  - `Weight (kg)`  
  - `BMI`  
  - `Calories` (daily intake in kcal)  
  - `BMI_calc` (BMI computed from weight & height)  
  - `cal_balance` (calorie intake minus estimated calories burned)  
  - `lean_mass_kg` (estimated lean body mass in kg)  
- Note: For new users (via interface), BMI, calorie balance and lean mass are computed automatically (based on weight, height, calories intake) so the user only needs to enter measurable inputs.
